    * Performed vulnerability assessment of Uptane by carrying out various cyber-attacks in a simulated environment
    * Prevented rollback and hardware mismatch attacks on Uptane, in case of a compromised software repository
    * Encrypted the updates, delivered using Uptane, by implementing hybrid end-to-end encryption (RSA2048 + AES128)
    * Added the support to externally sign a repository metadata in TUF using hardware security tokens (PIV/CCID)

    *Areas: Python, Secure Software Development, Encryption, Public Key Infrastructure, Systems Security*
